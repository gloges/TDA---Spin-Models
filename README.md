## Persistent Homology for Phase Transitions

Persistent homology is used on Monte-Carlo simulation of lattice spin models. Phase transitions, order parameters and critical exponents are extracted from persistence images for two-dimensional models. Straightforward interpretability allows for features such as magnetization, frustration and vortex-antivortex structure to be easily identified.

See the following for more details:
